INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

AI systems can be categorized into three types:
1. Narrow AI – Designed for a specific task such as voice assistants or recommendation systems.
2. General AI – Capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do.
3. Super AI – A theoretical form of intelligence that surpasses human intelligence.

MACHINE LEARNING BASICS

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions.

There are three major types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning – Uses labeled data to train models.
2. Unsupervised Learning – Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
3. Reinforcement Learning – Learns through rewards and punishments.

NEURAL NETWORKS

Neural Networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected neurons. Each neuron processes input and passes it through an activation function.

Key components of neural networks include:
- Input Layer
- Hidden Layers
- Output Layer
- Weights and Biases

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multiple hidden layers to process complex data such as images, audio, and text.

APPLICATIONS OF AI

Artificial Intelligence is widely used across industries:
- Healthcare: disease diagnosis and medical imaging
- Finance: fraud detection and trading systems
- Education: personalized learning and intelligent tutoring
- Transportation: self-driving cars and traffic optimization

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

As AI systems become more powerful, ethical issues arise such as:
- Data privacy
- Bias in algorithms
- Job displacement
- Transparency and accountability

Responsible AI development ensures fairness, reliability, and trustworthiness in intelligent systems.
